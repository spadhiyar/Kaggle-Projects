# Kaggle-Projects

The 2nd Annual Women in Data Science (WiDS) Datathon took place January 29 - February 27, 2019. The Global WiDS team, West Big Data Innovation Hub and the WiDS Datathon Committee worked together with Planet and Figure Eight to bring a dataset of high-resolution satellite imagery to participants, building awareness about deforestation and oil palm plantations.

Why oil palm?
Deforestation through oil palm plantation growth represents an agricultural trend with large economic and environmental impacts. From shampoo to donuts and ice cream, oil palm is present in many everyday products—but many have never heard of it explicitly! Because oil palm grows only in tropical environments, the crop’s expansion has led to deforestation, increased carbon emissions, and biodiversity loss, while at the same time providing many valuable jobs.

With the economic livelihoods of millions and the ecosystems of the tropics at stake, how might we work towards affordable, timely, and scalable ways to address the expansion and management of oil palm throughout the world?

High-resolution satellite imagery is a global, regularly-updated, and accurate source of data. Coupled with computer vision algorithms, it presents a promising opportunity for automated mapping of oil palm plantations, an important step toward understanding global impact.
